## Features Implemented

*   **User Authentication:** Secure Sign-up and Login functionality using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
*   **User Onboarding:** Initial assessment during signup to gather learning preferences, goals, interests, current level, and time commitment.
*   **Personalized Dashboard:** Overview of the user's active learning path, progress indicators, upcoming steps, and welcome message.
*   **Learning Path Generation:** Algorithm (currently basic, based on interests/level) to create customized learning sequences using available resources. Option to generate a new path.
*   **Learning Path Visualization:** Simple list view of the generated path with resource details (title, type, difficulty) and sequence.
*   **Progress Tracking:** Users can update the status (`Not Started`, `In Progress`, `Completed`) for each step (node) in their learning path. Progress is reflected on the dashboard.
*   **Resource Library:** Curated collection of learning resources (fetched from the database). Includes filtering by type/difficulty and basic text search.
*   **User Profile Management:** Users can view and update their profile information (name, goals, interests, level, preferences, time commitment).
*   **Responsive Design:** UI built with Tailwind CSS for responsiveness across different screen sizes.
*   **REST API Backend:** Backend built with Node.js and Express, providing API endpoints for frontend interaction.
*   **Database Integration:** MongoDB (via Mongoose) used for storing user data, resources, and learning paths.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18.x or later recommended) & npm
*   Git
*   MongoDB Atlas Account (or local MongoDB installation)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Garbii1/personalized-learning-path-app.git
    cd personalized-learning-path-app
    ```

2.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```

### Environment Variables

You need to create `.env` files for both the server and client directories.

1.  **Backend (`server/.env`):**
    Create a file named `.env` in the `server` directory and add the following variables:
    ```env
    # .env (server) - DO NOT COMMIT THIS FILE
    PORT=5001 # Or any port you prefer
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string # Get from MongoDB Atlas
    JWT_SECRET=your_very_strong_random_secret_key # Choose a strong random string
    ```
    *(Replace placeholders with your actual values)*

2.  **Frontend (`client/.env`):**
    Create a file named `.env` in the `client` directory and add the following variable (Vite requires the `VITE_` prefix):
    ```env
    # .env (client) - Safe to commit if only pointing to localhost for dev
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5001/api # Your local backend API base URL
    ```
    *(Make sure the port matches the `PORT` in the server's `.env`)*

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    Open a terminal in the `server` directory:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    *(This uses nodemon for auto-restarts during development)*

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    Open a *separate* terminal in the `client` directory:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    *(This starts the Vite development server, usually on `http://localhost:5173`)*

3.  Open your browser and navigate to the frontend URL provided by Vite (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

## Deployment

*   **Backend:** Deployed on **Railway** using their free tier. The `main` branch is linked, and deployments can be triggered automatically or manually. Environment variables (`MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`) are configured directly in the Railway service settings.
*   **Frontend:** Deployed on **Vercel** using their free tier. The project is linked to the GitHub repository, and Vercel automatically builds and deploys changes pushed to the `main` branch. The `VITE_API_BASE_URL` environment variable is configured in Vercel project settings to point to the deployed Railway backend URL.
*   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions were explored for backend deployment automation. Initial setup faced challenges with action identification (`Missing download info`), which were resolved by using the Railway CLI within a Docker container step.

---

## Challenges Faced & Solutions

*   **Dependency Versioning (Tailwind CSS):** Initially attempted to use Tailwind CSS v4 (alpha), which caused errors with the standard `npx tailwindcss init -p` command (`could not determine executable`).
    *   **Solution:** Realized v4 was in alpha and its setup differed. Explicitly uninstalled v4 and installed the latest stable v3 release (`tailwindcss@^3`) along with compatible `postcss` and `autoprefixer` versions, resolving the initialization issue.
*   **Frontend-Backend Integration (404 Errors):** After deployment, API calls from the Vercel frontend to the Railway backend were failing with 404 errors. The requested URL incorrectly combined the frontend and backend domains (e.g., `vercel.app/railway.app/api/...`).
    *   **Solution:** Diagnosed the issue as an incorrectly configured `VITE_API_BASE_URL` environment variable in Vercel. The variable likely lacked the `https://` prefix or was otherwise malformed, causing Axios to treat it as a relative path. Corrected the value in Vercel settings to the full, absolute URL of the deployed Railway API (`https://<your-railway-app-url>/api`) and redeployed the frontend.
*   **CI/CD Setup (GitHub Actions for Railway):** Encountered multiple `Error: Missing download info` failures when setting up the GitHub Actions workflow for backend deployment. Tried various incorrect action names (`railway/cli-action`, `railway/cli`, `railwayapp/cli`).
    *   **Solution:** Through trial-and-error and checking documentation/repository names, identified and used the Railway CLI directly in a Docker container (`ghcr.io/railwayapp/cli:latest`) as alternative approach. The core issue often stemmed from typos. Ensuring the `RAILWAY_TOKEN` secret was correctly configured was also crucial.
*   **CORS Configuration:** Ensured the backend Express server included the `cors` middleware and configured it appropriately (initially permissive for development, then potentially restricted to the specific Vercel frontend domain for production).
*   **State Management & Data Fetching:** Implemented basic data fetching and state management using `useState` and `useEffect`. Handled loading and error states for API calls to provide user feedback. Used `Promise.allSettled` on the dashboard to fetch profile and path data concurrently while handling potential individual fetch failures gracefully.

## Future Improvements

*   **Advanced Recommendation Algorithm:** Implement a more sophisticated algorithm (e.g., content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, or basic ML) for resource and path suggestions based on user history and similar users.
*   **AI Enhancements:** Integrate NLP for analyzing resource content or user goals. Use AI for more dynamic path adjustments.
*   **Social Features:** Allow users to find peers, join discussion forums, share progress, or potentially connect with mentors.
*   **Gamification:** Add points, badges, streaks, and leaderboards to increase engagement.
*   **Content Creation Tools:** Allow educators or admins to create and manage resources and potentially pre-defined learning paths.
*   **Enhanced Path Visualization:** Implement a more visual timeline or roadmap view for learning paths (e.g., using libraries like `react-vertical-timeline-component`).
*   **Improved Testing:** Add unit and integration tests for both frontend components and backend API endpoints.
*   **Mobile App / PWA:** Convert the application to a Progressive Web App (PWA) or develop a React Native mobile version.
*   **Admin Panel:** Create a dedicated interface for managing users, resources, and site settings.
